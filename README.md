otu2ot
======

A R package to determine oligotypes for DNA sequences.
The package provides R scripts to perform the oligotyping approach 
(http://oligotyping.org), as a way to exploring microbial patterns through 
subtle nucleotide variation within 16S rRNA gene sequences. 

To directly use the package into your R session, use the files:   
		* otu2ot_x.y.tar.gz (UNIX)   
		* otu2ot_x.y.zip (WINDOWS)


The R package is presented in: 
Ramette and Buttigieg, "The R package otu2ot for implementing the entropy decomposition of nucleotide 
variation in sequence data", submitted
